# -transfer-and-exchange-based-novel-heuristic-algorithm
This is a novel heuristic algorithm based on "transfer" and "exchange" operations. It is used to optimize the strategy of binary offloading of image processing tasks among a group of distributed devices.
The distributed image processing systems design and algorithm implementation are detailed in our paper on IEEE Transaction on Mobile Computing:
